# Interactive-Dashboard-For-Data-Analytics

The Goal of this Project was to :
1. Identify a problem with multi-variate data and perform analysis resulting in charts and other pictorial representations.
2. Discover patterns by analyzing the data.
3. Design a dashboard with multiple charts that offer insights into the data.
4. Build a data product by adding interaction to the charts to allow a user to understand the behavior of the data by changing values of parameters.
5. Publish a dashboard.

The Dashboard is an interactive medium for the users to infer the Box Office Profit which was calculated using Linear Regression and displaying the Trend Lines.

The collection of Dashboards represented by story uses various columns of the Movie Data Set showing the Country-wise Movie, Duration, Critic and User Reviews,IMDB score, Facebook likes of Cast and Directors, How the budget and gross of a movie are closely related etc.
